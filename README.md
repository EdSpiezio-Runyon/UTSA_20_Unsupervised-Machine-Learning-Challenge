# UTSA 20: Unsupervised Machine Learning Challenge

## Background
### This project aims to find better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness, using unsupervised learning techniques. The data science team of a medical research company has been provided with raw data and asked to explore whether there are distinct groups of patients that can be analyzed separately. The team has tried to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset but failed.

## Data
### The dataset contains 617 samples and 12-14 variables, depending on the algorithm being tested. The variables include information such as age, gender, parental myopia, and eye exam results.

## Methods
### The team has used two clustering algorithms, t-SNE and K-means, to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. However, neither algorithm was able to provide distinct clusters to predict whether a child will develop myopia.

## Results and Analysis
### The small sample size is likely the main contributing factor to the algorithms' inability to find sufficient patterns to make predictions. As the dataset contains several variables, the algorithms need a more extensive sample size to make complex predictions.

## Recommendations
### To improve the accuracy of any future predictions, the team recommends increasing the sample size by using a larger dataset or collecting more data. The models can then be reapplied to look for patterns to make prediction possible. The team also suggests considering other clustering algorithms or machine learning techniques to explore the data further.

## Conclusion
### Based on the results and analysis, it is crucial to communicate the findings and recommendations clearly to the team and other stakeholders. A visualization that shows the data points and the clusters that were identified by the algorithms can be used to explain why the algorithms were not able to provide distinct clusters and how the small sample size is likely the main contributing factor.
